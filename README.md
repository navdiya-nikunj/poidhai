# Poidh AI

Poidh AI is the client application for the POIDH protocol, designed to enable on-chain bounty creation across multiple blockchain networks, including Arbitrum, Base, and Degen. With the additional power of AI, Poidh AI also provides functionality for generating innovative and feasible bounty ideas. This project also includes a Farcaster frame implementation with the same functionality for users who prefer a decentralized social networking experience.

## Features

### 1. AI Idea Generation
- Leverages AI to generate bounty ideas that are compatible with real-world implementation.
- Ensures feasibility and relevance of the generated ideas, streamlining the bounty creation process.

### 2. Web3 Experience
- Provides seamless wallet connectivity using Reown's WalletKit.
- Allows users to interact effortlessly with their Web3 wallets to manage bounties.

### 3. Smart Contract Integration
- Facilitates on-chain bounty creation by interacting with the POIDH protocol smart contracts.
- Ensures transparency and immutability of bounties created on the blockchain.

### 4. Bounty Customization
- Enables users to customize bounty parameters such as:
  - Difficulty
  - Category
  - Bounty amount

### 5. Farcaster Frame Integration
- Implements the same functionality on Farcaster using frames.
- Frames are modular components that provide a compact and interactive experience for decentralized applications on the Farcaster protocol.
- Ensures that users can create and manage bounties seamlessly within the Farcaster ecosystem.


## What Are Frames?
Frames are a powerful feature of the Farcaster protocol that allow developers to create modular, self-contained applications or components. These frames can be embedded into the Farcaster client, providing users with a native and integrated experience for interacting with decentralized applications. By utilizing frames, Poidh AI ensures:
- Enhanced accessibility for Farcaster users.
- A smooth and interactive interface for creating and managing bounties.

## Supported Blockchains
Poidh AI supports the following blockchain networks:
- **Arbitrum**
- **Base**
- **Degen**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) compatible with the supported blockchains.
- Internet access to interact with the Poidh AI client or Farcaster frame.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/poidh-ai.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd poidh-ai
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Setup Env


### Usage
- Launch the application:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
- Connect your wallet using WalletKit.
- Use the AI idea generator to brainstorm bounty concepts.
- Customize bounty parameters and create bounties directly on the POIDH protocol.
